; Background-insensitive terminal colorscheme: 0 is bg and 15 is fg (most
; terminal colorschemes fix 0 to black and 15 to white). This is necessary for
; some terminal apps to work transparently in light background without changing
; their colorschemes when terminal colorscheme is changed. The problem is that
; they use 0,7,8,15 for bg/fg color and sometimes even mix them with terminal
; bg/fg color, assuming that they match the terminal bg/fg colors. Examples:
; bat's fg can't inherit terminal fg for fg, while bg does.
